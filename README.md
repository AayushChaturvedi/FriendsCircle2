# FriendsCircle

A Utility Application on Android Studio to help users especially students connect over the map to their friends.

Each friend will have a public profile through with which his exact location (by GPS) would be tracked over a highly-functional map,
through a server. Each friend will be the part of one or many groups. Friends could create a group specific and request others to join. Be it be
important lectures, or a declaration of a holiday, or may be a just a small get-together meeting, the app will create alerts time-to-time
on the users phone about the event and hence is perfect blend of social networking and Maps. Friends can also tell about personal events, 
and host the same !!
